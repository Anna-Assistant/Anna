### ADDITION OF NEW FEATURES 
[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Anna-Assistant/Anna/issues) 

To every new feature added in the Anna-Chrome Extension, first it must be declared as an **INTENT** in the corrosponding API agent. The `background.js` contains the main code and acts as a platform to addition of new features.

**TO ASSIGN ANNA A NEW FEATURE**  
To assign **_ANNA_** a new feature is pretty simple! :smiley:   
Once you open the `background.js` file you will find under _tasks()_ function the similar kind of _else if_ statements are used. You may think of this as a code snippet.  

> }else if (data.result.metadata.intentName === "INTENT_NAME") {  
> action to be performed.

The usage of `else if` statement is for obvious reasons, it checks for the Intent by it's name and accordingly performs the operation. 

#### NAMING CONVENTION
We all love consistency in the code. In order to tweak code or modify we ensure that we should not get confused by the thousands of lines of code, therefore we use a particular naming convention. We are proud to say that we too follow a particular naming convention with proper indentation of code so that a new contributor does not get confused with the flow of the code amd can easily contribute to the project.

 * **VARIABLES**  
   
   For variables we love to use "inner caps" for Multiple-Word Names.  
   For instance,look below at the code extracts taken from `background.js`.  
   
   > var byteString;  
   >var baseUrl = "https://api.api.ai/v1/";  
   >var targetId = null;  
   
   _The variable name should be relevent with the type of action to which that variable is used for._  
   
 * **FUNCTIONS**  
   
   For naming functions we too opt with the "inner caps" method for Multiple-Word Names.  
   For reducing the number of lines of code we love to put the starting parenthesis at the end of every function name only when the body of function is to be wriiten.   
   For example, look below at the code extracts taken from _background.js_.  
   
   >function takeScreenshot() {  
   >function processIt(data) {    
   
    _The function name should be relevent with the type of operation it is to be performed._  
                          
#### Followings steps can be taken into consideration for the ADDITION OF NEW FEATURE

* Think of something creatively that can be added as a feature.
* Create the corrosponding INTENT in the API.
* Tweak the code and assign the desired chrome operation to it.
* Follow the same convention as stated above for naming functions and variables in order to maintain uniformity in the code.
* Allot the permission in _manifest.json_ file,if the Chrome operation needs any permission.
* You are done.:+1:
