## How it works

Anna is a smart personal assistant that's available on Google Chrome as an extension. Once the extension is installed on Chrome, make sure that Anna is activated on the extensions settings window by switching the toggle switch to on, and then you're ready to start. Just say "hey" before a request, and Anna will perform the task for you.
