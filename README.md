  Click the Clone or download on extreme-right of header under the Code tab:
  If you don't see the button:

  Make sure you've selected <> Code tab from right side navigation menu, or
  Repo may not have a zip prepared. Add /archive/master.zip to the end of the repository URL and to generate a zipfile of the
  master branch:

http://github.com/user/repository/ -to-> http://github.com/user/repository/archive/master.zip
