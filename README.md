3. Take the downloaded ZIP file and extract it. We need to give it a permanent home because Chrome will externally load the files (if they get moved/deleted then the extension will stop working).
4. With the extension downloaded and extracted, we can now install it.In Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions
5. Installing the extension is extremely easy. All we need to do is drag-and-drop the folder we extracted onto Chrome’s Extensions page.If the extension is in the “.crx” format, Chrome will ask you to review and approve the permissions before installing.
